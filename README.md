# dobby (alpha)

dobby is a TeamSpeak 3 server management bot written in Rust. It's designed for the following use case:

1. available in every channel
2. speaks with one name
3. joins channels as they're created
4. automates channel deletion
5. really just acts as a middleman so we can code scripts in PHP or something else

-----------------

Dobby is built for and by [The First Church of Quibs](http://quibs.org/). It's currently in an alpha
state, so it's not advised to use it on your Teamspeak server yet.
